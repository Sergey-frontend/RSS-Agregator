## RSS Agregator
The RSS news aggregator is a platform that enables you to gather multiple news channels in one place. With this aggregator, you can easily add and manage your favorite news sources. The aggregator automatically updates and fetches new posts every 5 seconds, ensuring you stay up-to-date with the latest news. Instead of visiting each website individually, you can conveniently monitor the emergence of new posts from all sources and read their summaries within the aggregator. Stay informed and save time with the RSS news aggregator!<br/>
